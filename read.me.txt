This is my snake game! Here I tried to follow the most basic logic 
and create a simple algorithm. 

This is the second iteration of the game. In version 2.0 you've got
game, which is made with dependency injection. 

What have I done?

So in the very beginning I've got single file with all function,
macros, structures. But I've decided to separate info among three 
files:
1. Header1.h
2. Source1.c
3. red Snake.c

Header1: 
In the first file I put all my macros, which define width,
height and max length of snake. Also here my structures and all 
function, which I define. 

Source1:

In that file I put all libraries, which I used in my code and
include link to file Header.h. After that I put all my functions,
almost without changes. 

redSnake.c

This is my main file, there stayed link to file Header1 and my main 
function. So based on that logic I call for the main function 
and what goes inside it, later compiler initialization functions in
the Header file and call to Source1.c to execute them.
